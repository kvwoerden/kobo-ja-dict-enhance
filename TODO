TODO

- get rid of either one of the zip/7z, or both and do everything with
   Perl modules (WIP)

- Wrong entrie:
	<a name="だけ" /><b>たけ</b>【岳／嶽】<p>only‚ just‚ as<p>《
	We should NOT replace  a name=".." if there is a 【kanji】...
	Or maybe we should????

- Words that don't show up
	そして
	きびきび
	すばらしい
		because the Kanji lists 素晴（ら）しい
		so the matching does not work out!
	たけ as 岳
		becasue the Kanji lists 【岳／嶽】
		and we are checking only for 【岳】
	だけ
		as only ... although it has a Japanese3 entry!
